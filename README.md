A comprehensive standalone offline web application for project leaders running revenue-sharing creative teams with transparent, fair, and automatically-calculated splits.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a complete, zero-budget solution for managing revenue-sharing (revshare) teams. Perfect for indie game developers, creative collectives, and collaborative projects where compensation needs to be fair, transparent, and scalable.

**Key Features:**

- **Automated Fair Calculations**: Smart tier-based system with self-balancing algorithms ensures main contributors never get diluted, even as teams grow
- **Complete Transparency**: Every calculation is visible and verifiable by all team members
- **Lifetime Rewards**: Once someone earns a tier through their contributions, they receive payouts forever - no demotions, no performance anxiety
- **Scalable Design**: Works seamlessly for teams from 2 to 200+ members
- **Offline-First**: Runs entirely in your browser - no cloud dependency, no subscriptions, no data collection
- **Privacy-Focused**: Your data stays on your device, shared only with team members you choose
- **Clear Workflows**: Step-by-step guidance from initial setup to processing regular payouts

## ✨ Why This System Works

**The Problem:** How do you compensate people fairly when contributions vary wildly in scope and impact? How do you keep it simple long-term without making anyone's head explode?

**The Solution:** A tiered contribution system (Main, Assistant, Special Thanks, Fan) with mathematical formulas that automatically balance payouts as your team evolves. No contracts, no equity battles, no corporate structure required - just clear math, clean rules, and transparency.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🏆 Tiered Contribution System
- **Main Tier** - Essential contributors (project wouldn't exist without them)
- **Assistant Tier** - Valuable contributors (significantly enhance the project)
- **Special Thanks** - Meaningful contributors (smaller but notable contributions)
- **Fan Tier** - Minor helpers (credits only, no monetary payout)

Once you earn a tier, you keep it forever. Promotions happen based on increased contributions, but no demotions.

### ⚖️ Self-Balancing Protection
Mathematical safeguards ensure main contributors always receive at least 30% of revenue, preventing unfair dilution as teams grow with assistants and helpers.

### ⏰ Smart Payout Timing
- **Monthly** payouts when revenue is strong (€50+ per member)
- **Quarterly** payouts when lean (€15-50 per member)
- **Hold funds** when amounts are too small to justify transfer fees

Minimizes bank fees and maximizes what your team actually receives.
