        <h2 id="stage1-prerequisites">🎯 Stage 1: Before You Recruit Your First Coder</h2>

        <p>Before you post your recruitment notice looking for a coder, you should have something concrete to show. This isn't about being "professional" — it's about being <em>complete enough</em> to give potential teammates a clear sense of what you're asking them to build.</p>

        <h3>What You Should Have:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A game design showcase or pitch</strong> that communicates your project idea clearly. This could be:
                <ul>
                    <li>An HTML page with images and explanations</li>
                    <li>A video, animation, or slideshow walkthrough of the concept</li>
                    <li>An audio narration explaining the design by voice</li>
                    <li>An interactive mockup/demo showing the flow (even if it's not a real prototype)</li>
                    <li>A comprehensive pitch PDF with art, mockups, and detailed descriptions</li>
                    <li>Any combination of the above</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The showcase/pitch itself IS your evidence</strong> — it demonstrates your skills, your vision, and your commitment to the project</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity over polish</strong> — what matters is that someone can look at your showcase and understand what you want to create</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What NOT to Do:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Post with just text describing a vague idea in your head that hasn't been fleshed out</li>
            <li>Recruit without a tangible pitch to show a properly designed framework</li>
            <li>Be vague about what you're offering or what you bring to the table that the coder wont have to deal with</li>
            <li>Expect someone to code your game without an actual well-written and well-thoughout plan</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Coders get dozens of "idea guy" posts. By having a real showcase — something visual, tangible, thought-out — you immediately stand out as someone who's serious and has actually done the work to design something worth building.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="template1">📝 Template 1: Finding Your First Coder</h2>

        <p>This template is written in first person, as if you're speaking directly to potential teammates. Customize it with your details, keep the authentic tone, and post it where you're recruiting.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Revenue Split:</strong> For the initial team of project leader + coder, a simple <strong>50/50 split</strong> is recommended. If the team expands later, refer to the full tiered revshare system.</p>
        </div>

        <pre><code>[RevShare] Looking for a coder to team up with for [your project type]. I'm handling everything else.

--

## About Me
[Intro:] Hello, I'm [Your Name/Alias], a [brief description of yourself] from [location].

If you're a coder (or an AI-assisted coder), we could team up to create [platform] games with the intent to release them on [platforms like Itch, Steam, GoG, etc.]. Depending on the game we work on, it could be monetized as [paid game, free with DLC, donations, etc.].

## The Project
[Describe your project concept here. What makes it interesting? What's the core gameplay or purpose? What need does it fulfill? Be specific but concise.]
[If you have multiple project options, mention that and explain how the coder can choose which one to work on.]

[IMPORTANT: Link to your game design showcase here — your portfolio site, video walkthrough, PDF doc, interactive mockup, etc.]

## How This Works
You'll handle the coding (by hand or using AI tools, both are cool), while I handle art, sound, writing, marketing, publishing, guidance, and design. The revenue split will be <strong>50/50</strong> between us.

More people than just us are welcome. If we later bring on additional members (artists, musicians, writers, sound designers, etc.), they'll be included in the revenue share using a tiered system based on contribution impact for the project. Everyone participating will be credited like a rockstar in a manner that includes:
- Username/alias or real name (or both)
- Avatar picture (any kind)
- Up to 3 links/socials
- A 1-2 paragraph comment/description: what you worked on in the project, plus anything else you want to freely say, developer commentary, etc.

Links would be actual clickable links in-game that will open a web browser. The credits page will work more like a gallery/hall of fame rather than a traditional scrolling credits screen.

## Communication & Workflow
Ideally we'd work using online chat ([Discord/Telegram/Slack/etc.]) and some project management tool ([Trello/GitHub Projects/etc.]) that keeps us clear on the roadmap to milestones. We'll also have a [GitHub repo/Google Drive/shared folder/etc.] as a central hub for all materials related to the project — whenever you or I need to check on how something should be set up, what design decisions were made, or where to put and get assets, that'd be the place.

This allows us to work independently, collaboratively, without timezone conflicts, globally — all in a clear and organized way. I'll take responsibility for managing this, doing my best to facilitate your work without bothering you or leaving you unclear on what to do next.

There would be no deadlines. I trust the project will be developed as rapidly as it can be because we're both eager for it to succeed as soon as possible, but if something needs to be done right, then it will get the time to do it right. I trust you'll know when to step back and go for an easier/simpler approach if something becomes too hard or costly. I also trust that both of us have actual lives and real-world responsibilities, which will always take higher priority than the project.

## How to Get Started
1. Check out my game design showcase: [LINK]
2. [If offering choices: Pick ONE project you'd want to work on]
3. Contact me at [your email/Discord/preferred contact method]. Tell me about your skill level, [what project you want to work on if applicable], and why. Or ask questions.

Thanks!

        <h2 id="stage2-prerequisites">🎯 Stage 2: Before You Expand Your Team</h2>

        <p>Once you and your coder have built a working prototype, you might want to bring in additional talent — artists, musicians, writers, sound designers, marketers, etc. But before you recruit these specialists, make sure you have the fundamentals in place.</p>

        <h3>What You Should Have:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A working barebones prototype</strong> with placeholder assets — something that actually runs and demonstrates the core mechanics</li>
            <li><strong>Screenshots and/or video</strong> showing what you've built so far</li>
            <li><strong>A playable demo</strong> (even if rough) that people can try</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> The original game design docs plus new docs created during development</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Artists, musicians, and other specialists need to see that your project is real, functional, and that the core team can execute. A working prototype proves you're not just talking — you're building. Screenshots + playable demo = proof of skill, communication, progress, and partnership success.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What NOT to Do:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Expand the team before you have a working prototype</li>
            <li>Promise features or scope that don't exist yet</li>
            <li>Recruit people when you're still figuring out if the core concept works</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Gentle reminder:</strong> It's tempting to bring on an artist early because you're excited about the project. But without a working prototype, you're asking them to invest time in something that might not pan out. Wait until you have something solid, then recruit with confidence.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="template2">📝 Template 2: Recruiting Additional Team Members</h2>

        <p>This template is for when your project already has a working prototype and you're looking to bring on specialists. It's written in first person to show momentum and authenticity.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Revenue Split:</strong> With additional team members, you'll use the tiered revshare system which fairly compensates people based on their contribution level and project impact. Main contributors (like the original coder and project leader) remain in the Main Tier with full shares, while new members are assigned to tiers based on their role and contribution.</p>
        </div>

        <pre><code>[RevShare] [Project Name] is looking for [describe what you need, not a role title] — we have a working prototype and active development.

--

## About the Project
Hello, I'm [Your Name], the project leader for [Project Name]. We're building [brief description of the game/project] for [platforms].

We currently have a working prototype with [describe what's implemented — core mechanics, basic systems, etc.]. You can see it in action here:
- Screenshots: [LINK]
- Video: [LINK]
- Playable demo: [LINK if available]

[Optionally: Link to original design docs and development docs]

## What We're Looking For
Right now, we need help with [describe the problem/need rather than just a role title. Examples below]:

<strong>Examples of how to describe what you need:</strong>
- "Creating character sprites and environmental art in a [pixel art/hand-drawn/3D] style"
- "Composing atmospheric music tracks that fit [genre/mood]"
- "Writing dialogue and narrative content for [number] characters and story beats"
- "Designing and implementing sound effects for [game actions/environments]"
- "Building and managing our social media presence and community engagement"
- "Creating 3D models and animations for [characters/environments/props]"

[Describe specifically what this person would be working on, what assets or content they'd create, what problems they'd solve. Be as concrete as possible.]

## How This Works
Our team currently consists of [list current team members and their roles — e.g., "myself as project leader/designer/artist, and our coder who built the prototype"]. We work using [tools: Discord, Trello, GitHub, etc.] in an async, remote, no-deadlines environment.

Revenue sharing is handled through a tiered system that compensates people fairly based on their contribution level and impact on the project. You'd be evaluated for an appropriate tier (Main, Assistant, or Special Thanks) based on the scope and significance of your work. All contributing members receive lifetime payouts from revenue.

Everyone participating will be credited on a special in-game page that includes:
- Username/alias or real name (or both)
- Avatar picture (any kind)
- Up to 3 links/socials
- A 1-2 paragraph comment/description: what you worked on in the project, plus anything else you want to freely say, developer commentary, etc.

Links would be actual clickable links in-game that will open a web browser. The credits page works like a gallery/hall of fame showcasing each member like a rockstar.

## Our Workflow
We work independently, collaboratively, globally, without timezone conflicts. You'd have access to all project materials ([repo/drive/hub]) and clear guidance on what's needed. I handle project management and make sure you have everything you need to do your work without confusion.

There are no deadlines. We trust that the project develops as rapidly as it can because we're all eager for success, but we prioritize doing things right over doing things fast. We also understand that real life comes first.

## How to Get Started
1. Check out our prototype: [LINKS to screenshots/video/demo]
2. If this interests you, contact me at [email/Discord/preferred contact]. Tell me about your experience, show me examples of your work, and let me know why this project appeals to you.

Thanks!

        <h2 id="tips">💡 Tips for Successful Recruiting</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Clearly state what you need and what you're offering in return</li>
            <li><strong>Show your work:</strong> Always link to your showcase, prototype, screenshots, or demos</li>
            <li><strong>Be honest:</strong> Don't oversell the project or make promises you can't keep</li>
            <li><strong>Respect people's time:</strong> Make your post easy to skim with clear sections and formatting</li>
            <li><strong>Be transparent about AI use:</strong> Many developers appreciate knowing if AI tools are welcomed</li>
            <li><strong>Set clear expectations:</strong> Be upfront about revenue sharing, workflow, and time commitment (or lack of deadlines)</li>
            <li><strong>Follow up promptly:</strong> When people reach out, respond quickly and respectfully</li>
            <li><strong>Show personality:</strong> Let your authentic voice come through — people join teams, not job postings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The "idea guy" trap:</strong> Don't recruit without having done significant design work yourself. Show what you've already created.</li>
            <li><strong>Premature expansion:</strong> Don't recruit artists, musicians, or writers before you have a working prototype. Wait until you have something real to show.</li>
            <li><strong>Vague descriptions:</strong> Instead of "looking for an artist," say "looking for someone to create 2D art for characters in a side-view game."</li>
            <li><strong>Overpromising:</strong> Don't promise revenue, success, or features you can't guarantee. Be realistic and honest.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring the showcase:</strong> Your game design showcase or working prototype is your credibility. Without it, your post looks like everyone else's.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Remember</h3>
            <p>Good team members are attracted to projects that show genuine effort, clear vision, and respectful collaboration. Your recruitment post is your first impression — make it count by being honest, showing your work, and treating potential teammates as creative partners, not just hired hands.</p>
