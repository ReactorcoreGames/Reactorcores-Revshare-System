                                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> This system is built on trust and transparency. Understanding the philosophy helps you use it correctly and explain it to your team. Once you're ready to dive deeper, visit the <strong>Info & FAQ</strong> tab for complete documentation on the tier system, formulas, and philosophy.</p>
                                <p><strong>Next step:</strong> Decide if you're starting fresh or loading an existing project file.</p>

                                <h3>Set Up Your "Payout Hub" Account (One-Time Setup)</h3>
                                <p><strong>What you're doing:</strong> Create a dedicated bank account, PayPal, or similar account that's ONLY for this project's payouts. Keep it separate from your personal money.</p>
                                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Separation makes accounting crystal clear. When money comes in from game sales, it goes there. When payouts happen, money leaves from there to team members. At the end of each payout cycle, this account returns to €0. This makes it impossible to mix project money with personal money, keeps everything transparent, and makes tax reporting much simpler.</p>
                                <p><strong>Think of it as:</strong> Your project's wallet - money flows in from platforms, gets split among the team, and empties out completely each cycle.</p>

                                <h3>Build Your Team List</h3>
                                <p><strong>What you're doing:</strong> Go to the <strong>Team & Credits</strong> tab. Add everyone contributing to the project and assign them to tiers based on their lifetime impact:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Main Tier</strong> = Essential contributors (project wouldn't exist without them)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Assistant Tier</strong> = Valuable contributors (enhance the project significantly)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Special Thanks</strong> = Meaningful contributors (smaller but notable contributions)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fan Tier</strong> = Minor helpers (get credits but no money - for playtesters, small favors, etc.)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Tier placement determines how much each person earns forever. It's based on lifetime project impact, not current work. Once someone earns a tier, they keep it permanently - no demotions, no performance anxiety. Take your time getting this right.</p>
                                <p><strong>Important:</strong> You can promote people to higher tiers later if they contribute more, but you can't demote them. Tiers are eternal rewards for past contributions.</p>

                                <p><strong>What you're doing:</strong> Click the <strong>💾 Save</strong> button at the top of the page. This downloads a JSON file with today's date in the filename (like <code>MyGame_2025-01-15T14-30-00.json</code>).</p>
                                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> This web app works entirely offline and doesn't store anything permanently. Your team-project data file is THE source of truth. It contains all your team members, their tiers, complete payout history, and project info. Without this file, all your work disappears when you close the browser.</p>
                                <p><strong>Critical:</strong> Keep this file safe! Make backup copies. Share a copy with your team members so they can verify everything is fair by loading it into their own copy of this web app.</p>
                                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The filename includes the date and time, so if you have multiple versions lying around, they'll sort alphabetically - newest file = latest version.</p>

                                <h3>When Sales Come In: Wait & Collect Revenue</h3>
                                <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Your game sells on platforms like itch.io, Steam, or mobile stores. The platform automatically takes their cut (itch.io ~15%, Steam 30%, etc.). What's left sits in the platform's system.</p>
                                <p><strong>What you do:</strong> Manually withdraw/transfer this money from the platform into your hub account. Don't do this immediately every time - wait until enough revenue accumulates to justify the transfer fees.</p>
                                <p><strong>Why timing matters:</strong> Bank transfer fees can eat into small amounts. The system recommends monthly payouts when you have €50+ per team member, quarterly payouts for €15-50 per member, and waiting longer if amounts are smaller. This maximizes what your team actually receives.</p>

                                <h3>Load Your Data & Calculate the Split</h3>
                                <p><strong>What you're doing:</strong> Drag and drop your team-project data file anywhere on this web app (works from any tab!), or click the <strong>📂 Load</strong> button to browse for it. Then go to the <strong>Payout Calculator</strong> tab.</p>
                                <p><strong>Enter the numbers:</strong> Put in the EXACT amount now sitting in your hub account (after platform cuts, after transfer fees). Set the payout date. Add optional notes if you want.</p>
                                <p><strong>Hit calculate:</strong> The web app does all the math using the tier system. It shows you exactly who gets what, applies self-balancing fairness if needed, and gives you payout timing recommendations.</p>
                                <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> The math is transparent and verifiable. Anyone on your team can load the same data file and see the same calculations. No black boxes, no trust issues.</p>

                                <p><strong>Option A - Just Planning:</strong> If you're just checking what a payout would look like (maybe planning ahead, or testing different amounts), just review the numbers and close the tab. Don't commit it. The calculation disappears and nothing is logged.</p>
                                <p><strong>Option B - Real Payout:</strong> If you're actually doing this payout for real, click <strong>"Commit Payout to Timeline"</strong>. This permanently logs it in your History tab and in your team-project data file.</p>
                                <p><strong>Why the distinction matters:</strong> You can run unlimited "what if" scenarios without polluting your actual payout history. Only commit when you're actually sending money.</p>

                                <h3>Send Money to Everyone</h3>
                                <p><strong>The tedious part:</strong> Manually send money to each team member from your hub account. Use bank transfers, PayPal, Stripe - whatever payment method works for each person.</p>
                                <p><strong>Document everything:</strong> Take a screenshot of EVERY transaction showing the amount, recipient, and date. This proves you sent the money and protects you from disputes.</p>
                                <p><strong>Why this takes time:</strong> If you have many team members, this can take an hour or more of careful data entry. Double-check amounts and payment details before hitting send. One mistake could send money to the wrong person or wrong amount.</p>
                                <p><strong>Patience is key:</strong> This is boring, slow work that requires focus. Don't rush it. Your team is counting on you to get it right.</p>

                                <p><strong>What you're doing:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Click <strong>💾 Save</strong> at the top to download your updated team-project data file (now includes the new payout in the timeline)</li>
                                    <li>Go to the <strong>History</strong> tab and export reports if needed (full report as Markdown, or timeline as CSV)</li>
                                    <li>Share the updated data file with your team members (via Google Drive, Discord, email - your choice)</li>
                                    <li>Archive your transaction screenshots in a shared folder so everyone can verify the money was sent</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Why transparency matters:</strong> Trust is built through verification. When team members can see the calculations, load the data file themselves, and view transaction proofs, there's no room for suspicion or disputes.</p>
                                <p><strong>Check your hub:</strong> Your hub account should now be back at €0. If it's not, you missed someone or made a calculation error.</p>

                                <h3>Repeat Forever</h3>
                                <p><strong>The cycle:</strong> When enough revenue accumulates again, you repeat from step 5. Load your latest data file, calculate the new payout, commit it, send the money, save everything, share with team.</p>
                                <p><strong>As your team grows:</strong> When new people join or existing members contribute more, update their tiers in the Team tab, save the file, and the new split automatically applies to future payouts.</p>
                                <p><strong>That's it:</strong> You now have a sustainable, fair, transparent revenue sharing system that scales with your project and respects everyone's contributions forever.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>The tier system (Main/Assistant/Special Thanks/Fan), the self-balancing math that keeps it fair as teams grow, lifetime rewards (no demotions), and the hub account concept. The web app handles all calculations automatically - you just need to understand WHY it works this way.</p>

                            <h4 class="faq-question">How is this different from just splitting revenue equally among everyone?</h4>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Equal splits don't account for vastly different contribution levels and create perverse incentives (minor contributors get same reward as essential ones). This system rewards impact fairly: someone who builds the entire game engine shouldn't get the same share as someone who created 3 sound effects. The tier system solves this while still being transparent and fair.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>No! This is designed for zero-budget indie teams. You operate on trust, honor, and MIT licensing. You only need a business registration later when moving to Steam/GOG (Phase 2), which happens after you're already earning steady income from Phase 1 platforms (itch.io, Ko-fi, etc.).</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Zero budget means no upfront costs - no lawyers, no incorporation fees, no contracts, no equity battles, no office space, no salaries. Payment accounts (PayPal, bank accounts) are free to create. Transfer fees exist but the threshold system minimizes them by only doing payouts when amounts are substantial enough to justify the fees.</p>

                                <p>Absolutely! The tier ratios (1.0 / 0.5 / 0.167), thresholds (€50/€15), and self-adjusting algorithm (30% minimum for main tier) are recommendations that work well. You can adjust these, add more tiers, change currencies, or adapt the philosophy to fit your team culture. The web app is flexible - the system is a framework, not a prison.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Evaluate based on lifetime project impact: Would the project exist without them (Main)? Do they significantly enhance it (Assistant)? Did they make smaller but meaningful contributions (Special Thanks)? Tiers are permanent and can only be promoted, never demoted. Take your time - it's better to start conservative and promote later than to over-assign initially. When in doubt, start them in Assistant tier and observe their long-term impact.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Yes - that's a feature, not a bug! Tiers reward historical contributions, not ongoing performance. If someone built a critical system that powers your game, they deserve ongoing compensation even if they move on to other projects. This creates a healthy culture where people can contribute without fear of being trapped or penalized for life changes. Only actual malicious sabotage results in tier removal.</p>

                                <p>Tier placement is about impact and quality, not just volume. If their contributions don't meaningfully improve the project or require excessive rework, they might belong in Special Thanks or Fan tier despite high effort. Be honest and kind - volume without value doesn't earn higher tiers. This is why tier assignment is subjective and handled by the project leader's judgment.</p>

                                <p>Yes, you can have multiple Main tier members - the tier is about contribution impact, not authority. However, operationally, only ONE person should be the "project leader" handling the hub account, tier assignments, and payout processing for clarity and accountability. Decision-making conflicts should be resolved through discussion and consensus, or deferred to the designated project leader as the final authority. Define this clearly when setting up your team.</p>

                                <p>For a 2-3 person team, aim for at least €100 total revenue (about €30-50 per person) for the first payout. Smaller amounts get eaten by transfer fees. Use the web app's payout frequency recommendations - they're designed to maximize what your team actually receives. Many indie games take 6-12 months post-launch to reach consistent revenue, so be patient and keep building.</p>

                                <p>No revenue = no payouts. Everyone joins knowing this is revshare (revenue sharing), not salary. If the game doesn't earn money, nobody gets paid - including you as project leader. You all share the risk together. People still get credited in the game regardless, and they can use that for their portfolio.</p>

                                <p>For small teams (2-5 people), expect 30-60 minutes to calculate, process payments, document everything, and share updated files. For larger teams (10+ people), this can easily take 2-4 hours due to manual payment processing for each person, verification checks, screenshot documentation, and careful attention to avoid errors.

                                <p>The web app works entirely offline with no cloud storage - your data lives in the team-project JSON file you save. If you didn't click "Save" before closing, your work is gone. ALWAYS save your work frequently! The app shows warnings when no file is loaded. Treat your team-project file like the source of truth - back it up, share copies with your team, and save after every change.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>The file contains names/aliases, emails, payment addresses, roles, tiers, and payout history. Remove or anonymize sensitive payment addresses before sharing if needed. Store it in a view-only shared folder (Google Drive, Dropbox) that only paid tier members (Main/Assistant/Special Thanks) can access, not Fan tier. Keep the full version with payment details in your private local backup.</p>

                                <p>Yes! Each project gets its own team-project JSON file. Save them with clear names like "MyGame_2025-01-15.json" and "OtherProject_2025-01-20.json". Load whichever file you need to work on. The app doesn't care how many projects you manage - each file is completely independent.</p>

                            <h4 class="faq-question">This seems great for small teams, but does it really scale to 50+ people? 200+ people?</h4>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Yes, with caveats. The math scales beautifully thanks to the self-adjusting fairness algorithm. The operational burden (manually processing 50+ payments, managing that many relationships, handling disputes) is the real challenge. At very large scales, consider splitting into sub-projects with their own teams, or hiring someone specifically to handle payout operations (and placing them in Assistant/Main tier for this critical role). The system CAN scale mathematically; the question is whether YOU can scale operationally.</p>

                            <h4 class="faq-question">Why should I trust this system and philosophy? What if the project leader screws everyone over?</h4>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Trust is earned, not assumed. As a team member: Ask to see the team-project file, verify calculations yourself by loading it into the web app, request transaction proofs (screenshots), and check the payout history. As a project leader: Provide all of this proactively and communicate clearly. The system is designed for transparency - use it. If a leader refuses to share data or acts shady, that's a red flag to leave. The system works ONLY when everyone operates in good faith.</p>
